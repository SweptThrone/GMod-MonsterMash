# Monster Mash
Monster Mash is a wacky deathmatch gamemode with a dangerous obsession with Halloween. With over 30 weapons and 10 characters, you can dismember your opponents and make them walk the earth with no arms or legs. Win the highscore by performing chain attacks or using unique loadouts, encouraging different playstyles and counter loadouts. <br><br>

But don't worry, you won't just be killing other players, as you might be forced to work together in order to combat a greater force. <br><br>

Please be aware that the code is incredibly messy. This gamemode was developed over the course of 3 years, with many of its goals and ambitions changing constantly throughout. As a result, much of the code is bodge on top of bodge, resulting in the frankenstein code you might encounter. There were many nights spent rewriting code at 3AM, so if it's stupid but it works then it's not stupid in my books. There are many things that will eventually be cleaned up and streamlined (especially weapon related code), but when that will happen depends on a lot of factors. Frankly, now that we already know what we're including and not including in the gamemode, a complete rewrite from the ground up would be a much better idea, that I probably won't be entertaining anytime soon.<br><br>
